# GTAIVtoGTAV
Simple Converter Script

Tutorial :

1. Make sure FiveM is installed at C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\FiveM\FiveM.app
2. Download the files
3. Place in an empty folder
4. Drag GTA IV files (Supported and Un-Supported) to the /files folder (Supports .wdr, .wtd, .wbn )
5. Run converter.bat OR run converter2.bat (converter2.bat does not open multiple windows and is better suited for laptops)

This should automatically remove all GTA IV files leftover, however in the case that it doesn't, run the delete.bat file

count.bat lists how many files from the supported types you have in the folders

helptherearesomanycmdsnow.bat is a legacy script from when this would crash the computer with insane amounts of CMD windows

## I make other stuff too

P.S. 
You need OpenIV to open the GTA IV files, once open you can find the convertable files in these folders

pc/data/maps

pc/data/models/cdimages

pc/data/textures
